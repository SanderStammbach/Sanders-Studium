abstract = {We present a derivation of the Lindblad equation -an important tool for the treatment of nonunitary evolutions -that is accessible to undergraduate students in physics or mathematics with a basic background on quantum mechanics. We consider a specific case, corresponding to a very simple situation, where a primary system interacts with a bath of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature, with an interaction Hamiltonian that resembles the Jaynes-Cummings formato We start with the Born-Markov equation and, tracing out the bath degrees of freedom, we obtain an equation in the Lindblad formo The specific situation is very instructive, for it makes it easy to realize that the Lindblads represent the effect on the main system caused by the interaction with the bath, and that the Markov approximation is a fundamental condition for the emergence of the Lindbladian operator. The formal derivation of the Lindblad equation for a more general case requires the use of quantum dynamical semi-groups and broader considerations regarding the environment and temperature than we have considered in the particular case treated here.},

@article{Horowitz2020,
abstract = {In equilibrium thermodynamics, there exists a well-established connection between dynamical fluctuations of a physical system and the dissipation of its energy into an environment. However, few similarly quantitative tools are available for the description of physical systems out of equilibrium. Here, we offer our perspective on the recent development of a new class of inequalities known as thermodynamic uncertainty relations, which have revealed that dissipation constrains current fluctuations in steady states arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We discuss the stochastic thermodynamic origin of these inequalities, and highlight recent efforts to expand their applicability, which have focused on connections between current fluctuations and the fluctuation theorems.},

@article{Li2017,
abstract = {We study the statistics of the lasing output from a single atom quantum heat engine, which was originally proposed by Scovil and Schulz-DuBois (SSDB). In this heat engine model, a single three-level atom is strongly coupled with an optical cavity, and contacted with a hot and a cold heat bath together. We derive a fully quantum laser equation for this heat engine model, and obtain the photon number distribution for both below and above the lasing threshold. With the increase of the hot bath temperature, the population is inverted and lasing light comes out. However, we notice that if the hot bath temperature keeps increasing, the atomic decay rate is also enhanced, which weakens the lasing gain. As a result, another critical point appears at a very high temperature of the hot bath, after which the output light become thermal radiation again. To avoid this double-threshold behavior, we introduce a four-level heat engine model, where the atomic decay rate does not depend on the hot bath temperature. In this case, the lasing threshold is much easier to achieve, and the double-threshold behavior disappears.},

@article{Niedenzu2019,
abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in quantum thermodynamics concerns the decomposition of energetic changes into heat and work. Contrary to classical engines, the entropy change of the piston cannot be neglected in the quantum domain. As a consequence, different concepts of work arise, depending on the desired task and the implied capabilities of the agent using the work generated by the engine. Each work quantifier-from ergotropy to non-equilibrium free energy-has well defined operational interpretations. We analyse these work quantifiers for a heat-pumped three-level maser and derive the respective engine efficiencies. In the classical limit of strong maser intensities the engine efficiency converges towards the Scovil-Schulz-DuBois maser efficiency, irrespective of the work quantifier.},
