As always, we work in an interaction picture where the
signal frequency has been shifted to zero. D represents
the effective operating bandwidth of the amplifier. Com-
ponents of the signal with frequencies (in the rotating
frame) |ω| ␜ D are strongly amplified, while components
with frequencies |ω| ␝ D are not amplified at all, but
can in fact be slightly attenuated. As we already antici-
pated, the amplification bandwidth D becomes progres-
sively smaller as the
√ pump power and G0 are increased,
with the product G0 D remaining constant. In a para-
metric amplifier increasing the gain via increasing the
pump strength comes with a price: the effective operat-
ing bandwidth is reduced.
